C programming:

-->Compilation process of the c programming

-->Memory map 
    ->.data (intilaized global and staic variable)
    ->.bss ( non-initilaized global and static variables intilaized to 0)
    ->.text (code segment /read only)
    ->stack (local variable)
    -->heap (dynamic alloaction)

-->Storage class
    ->auto (default / value-grabage , scope-local , lifetime -within the block it is declared)
    ->register (cpu register, value-grabage, scope-local, lifetime -within the bloack it is declared)
    ->global (scope global)
    ->static ()

-->Static variable  
    ->static local ( retains value for the variable within different function call)
    -->static global (accesible only in the file in which it is declared , scope is dame as global)
    -->static function (sccesible only in the program file in whic it is declared , outside files will not be able to access)
                        (generally the function will be extern)

-->const keyword
    -->const means  read only variable  
    -->const variables should not appear on the left side of the assignment opeartor , will get lvalaue error


-->Volatile keyword 
    -->Volatile keyword tells the compiler or force the compiler not to do the optimization for that variables  
        -->the variable which are most likely to change due to external event or unexpectedly are set as Volatile   
        -->every type the variable will be read from the memory and not from the cache register 
        -->read by pin , not by latch

-->Structure and Union differnece
    -->used for the storing the variables of the differnet datatype
    -->in structure padding is used for memory allignment
    -->the size of the union is the size of the largets element of the union    
    -->padding in structure can be avoided by the pragma pack/attribute


-->What is dynamic memory allocation..?
    -->How to allocate the dynamic memory in C..?
        -->What is the differnece between the malloc and calloc
            -->int *p = (int*)malloc(5*sizeof(int));
            -->int *q = (int*)calloc (5, sizeof(int));
        -->syntax of the malloc and calloc  
        -->What does the malloc returns.
        -->What is the use of the free()
            free(p);
            free(q);
        -->How to realoocate the dynamic memory with differnet size 
            -->realloc syntax

-->What is pointer
    Pointer is the variable which is used to store the memeory adddres of the another variables
    -->the value of the pointer variable is the address of the naother variable;

-->What is NULL pointer

-->What is the dangling pointer

-->What is memory leakage..?

-->What  is segmentation fault, when can it occur..?

-->What is array
    -->Array is the derived data type which is used to store the variable of the same data type
        -->in the consecutive memeory order.

-->What is string
    -->String is basically the chacter array ending the with the null terminator or null chancter '\0'.

-->What is funcion, function pointer, callback function..?
